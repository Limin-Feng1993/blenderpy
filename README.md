# blenderpy
Blender as a python module with easy-install

Meant for installation into a virtualenv or wherever, for unit testing of Blender extensions being authored, or developement of a Blender 3d-enabled Python application.

Depends upon the `bpy-build` and `bpy-ensure` modules to make sure the Blender `bpy` module environment is correct.

For more information, please see:

## FAQ

### Q. How do I import addons?

### Q. How can I use Blender in `multiprocessing`?

A. Blender runtime usage and compatibility with `multiprocessing` is limited, see [the documentation](https://github.com/TylerGubala/blenderpy/wiki/Caveat---Usage-with-multiprocessing).

## Gotchas

I have not tested this for platforms other than Windows at the moment. More to come soon.
